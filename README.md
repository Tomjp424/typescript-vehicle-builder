## Installation
Download the zip from the [Github repo](https://github.com/Tomjp424/typescript-vehicle-builder). Once extracted, open the file in Git Bash or the integrated terminal of your IDE of choice and type `npm i`. This will install all the necessary dependencies for the app to run.

## Usage
Click [here](https://youtu.be/V3n841tTXZs) for a video walkthrough.

With the files open in your terminal, type `npm start` to run the application. From there you will be prompted to either create a new vehicle or select an existing one. If you select create new, you will be prompted to enter various parameters for the vehicle such as make, model, color, etc. Once that is complete, you will automatically be prompted to perform actions with the selected vehicle. From here, you can do things like start the vehicle, accelerate, decelerate, and turn. If you have a truck selected, you can additionally tow another vehicle, assuming it does not exceed the truck's towing capacity. Likewise, with a motorbike selected, you can perform a wheelie.

## Testing
Testing may involve creating various vehicle types with extreme parameters such as weight, and attempting as many actions as possible with them. Ensure that cars cannot tow, trucks cannot wheelie, and the like.
